## üìÅ Project Structure

TaskFlow follows a modular organization for better maintainability and scalability:

### Core Components

* `app.py` - Entry point of the application that initializes the Streamlit interface and manages the overall workflow

### Directories

* `/pages` - Contains individual Streamlit pages for different views and functionality
  * Handles UI components for job management, template creation, and execution monitoring
  
* `/scripts` - Repository for all executable job scripts
  * Stores user-created scripts that get executed according to schedule
  
* `/templates` - Collection of reusable job templates
  * Pre-defined script templates that can be used as starting points for new jobs
  
* `/data` - Storage for application state and historical information
  * `jobs.json` - Maintains the current configuration of all created jobs
  * `history.json` - Records comprehensive execution history with timestamps and results

## üçì Raspberry Pi Setup  

Ensure TaskFlow starts automatically when your Raspberry Pi boots up using `systemd` with these simple steps:

1. Create a service file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/taskflow.service
   ```

2. Add the following content:  
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=TaskFlow
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/TaskFlow/app.py
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/TaskFlow
   Restart=always
   User=pi

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. Save the file and reload `systemd`:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. Enable the service to start on boot:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable taskflow
   ```

5. Start the service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start taskflow
   ```

6. Stop the service:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop taskflow
   ```

7. Check the status:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status taskflow
   ```
